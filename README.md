## Research

Research question: How did the lockdown periods during the COVID-19 period affect flight traffic from the Netherlands to other European Countries in comparison to non-lockdown periods?

Additional Questions:
- Has the flight time between the different airports changed during these periods? (multiple statistics)
- How did the delay times evolve over the COVID period in comparison to the years previous to COVID? (multiple statistics)

COVID-19 period is defined as January 17th 2020 to 30th May 2022. This has been defined from using the timeline of the Dutch Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-tijdlijn

The lockdown period are defined as:
- Eerste lockdown: 15/03/2020 to 11/05/2020
- Gedeeltelijke lockdown: 13/10/2020 to 19/11/2020
- Tweede lockdown: 15/12/2020 to 28/04/2021
- Gedeeltelijke lockdown (na tweede lockdown): 28/04/2021 to 26/06/2021
- Derde lockdown (harde lockdown): 14/12/2021 to 26/01/2022
